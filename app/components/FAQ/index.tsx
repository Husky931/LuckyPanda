            question: "What do i get in my box",
            answer: "Inside each box, youâ€™ll receive anywhere from 16, up to 20 carefully selected items, all of which are authentic Chinese sweets and snacks. Each item is sourced from local stores, shops and makers, showcasing the diversity and craftsmanship of Chinese snacks, an industry that is starting to really expand recently. The snacks will vary in flavor, going from sweet and sour, to savoury bites (with sweets being the biggest chunk), as we try to include most flavors for better experience. It is planned to have 2 drinks in each box, but currently the shipping channels we use prohibit transportation of liquid, we are trying to work around this."

            question: "Allergy / nutrition information",

        },
        {
            category: "General",
            question: "The date on the snacks product packaging",
            answer: "Unlike the West, Chinese snack packaging usually displays the production date rather than the expiration date. According to China's National Standard GB7718-2011, all prepackaged foods must include the production date and the shelf life. We ensure that no products are shipped if they are expired or set to expire within 45 days of dispatch."
